# Stamp Network

## Overview
Stamp Network is a fully-responsive social media platform for students to ask each other questions in a centralized forum within their class 
and/or school.
It was designed in collaboration with 3 other students during Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program in 2017 sponsored by BlackRock NYC.

## Details
On the back-end, Stamp Network runs using Python (with assistance from the Django framework) and JavaScript. On the front-end, the website was designed 
using HTML/CSS, assisted by Bootstrap.
