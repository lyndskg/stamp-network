# Stamp Network

## Overview
Stamp Network is a fully-responsive social media platform for students to ask each other questions in a centralized forum within their class 
and/or school.
It was designed in collaboration with 3 other students during Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program in 2017 sponsored by BlackRock NYC.

## How it works
On the back-end, Stamp Network runs using Python (with assistance from the Django framework) and JavaScript. On the front-end, the website was designed 
using HTML/CSS, further assisted by Bootstrap. 

## Details 
Using Stamp Network, a student may add many things to their personal profile -- including classes they are currently taking or have taken, elective courses
or language courses that they are enrolled in, as well as any work experience they may have. 

On the interactive side of the social media platform, students may post questions or concerns they may have to other students currently enrolled in the
courses they are taking. 

Admin functionalities also allow teachers to similarly create accounts, add courses to their profile, and interact with or monitor students' posts.
